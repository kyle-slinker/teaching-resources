This reference sheet is used by almost all physics classes at NCSSM in order to give students a consistent resource, minimize the need to memorize, and reduce test anxiety. Laminated copies are in all classrooms for students to practice with during class time and use during quizzes. I introduced this coordinated document and have maintained its updated versions for a number of years.
