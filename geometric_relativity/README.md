This series of activities is designed to introduce students to concepts in special and general relativity using a minimum of pre-requisites. Calculus is not assumed. Topics covered include Einstein's mass-energy relation, black holes, and the expanding Universe, among many others. Note that many of the questions are quite difficult and these activities are generally intended to be done in the classroom with an instuctor available.
