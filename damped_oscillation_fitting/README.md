# Damped oscillation fitting

This series of activities is designed to allow students to explore numerical modeling and damped oscillations. Calculus and prior programming experience are likely beneficial. Topics covered include chi^2 fitting, evaluating and constructing numerical models, gradient descent, and forms of drag, among others. No specific activity is provided to go along with this, though there are undoubtedly a wide variety of ways these materials could be utilized.

Instructors who have any questions about these materials can contact the authors at kyle.slinker@ncssm.edu.

More resources are expected to be added to this soon.
