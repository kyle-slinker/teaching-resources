This series of activities is designed to introduce students to numerical modeling and solar system dynamics using a minimum of pre-requisites. Calculus and prior programming experience are not assumed. Topics covered include Kepler's law, numerical modeling, and solar system dynamics, among others. Note that many of the questions are quite difficult and these activities are generally intended to be done in the classroom with an instuctor available.

Instructors who have any questions about these materials can contact the author at kyle.slinker@ncssm.edu.
